focus on design and consuming linked data via APIs to enrich digital content. It would be great to particularly consider what role 'open' plays regarding linked data and the semantic web. Looking back at the slides that you shared with me in Lausanne, I think that your SKOS and Linked Data presentation seems to hit the right level, perhaps with a focus on one use case in the digital humanities (e.g. something from CENDARI or the medieval illuminated manuscript you mention?). The 'common understanding' slide showing the difference between vocabularies, thesauri, taxonomies and ontologies is great!  Having said that, I think that publishing content (i.e. sharing) is an important part of any linked data project especially in the context of openness and needs to be considered right from the start.  Therefore my feeling is that it would be good to also mention it.  Does that help at all?  Perhaps JÃ¶rg also has some thoughts regarding this too?
